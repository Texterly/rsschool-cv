### About Me

---

I'm a Frontend developer. I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, Github, React.

I know how to work in a team. I believe that success of any project is the result of collaboration of all the people involved in it. I am always ready to come to the rescue of my colleagues, as I believe that mutual assistance is a crucial component of success in any deals. Now I am actively interested in the topic of IT (studying at courses, attending conferences, reading books).
